For this assignment, I decided to implement an N-Body simulation for the particles. I implemented this in a computer shader using a simple O(N^2) algorithm that compares each particle to all the others to calculate the attractive gravitational force of the particle, and then adds this to a sum of velocity and updates the position of the particle based on the particle's current velocity. I provided a timestep control which changes the time increment the velocity is calculated in. Increasing the timestep speeds up the simulation.

I did not manage to get any one in the class to look at the simulation in time, but I did have my roommate look at it. She thought it looked cool.
