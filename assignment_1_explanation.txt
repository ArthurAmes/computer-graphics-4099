For assignment 1, I was primarily interested in exploring how I could draw and offset different lines. I wanted something that started out simple, but gradually built up to something more complex. I also tried to achieve an asthetic of "two-sidedness" by sticking to black and white except for in the transition area, which I thought added a nice visual contrast. I started out by drawing a line by taking the sign of the perpendicular dot product, but I did not like the harsh edges created by the sign function. I tried to smooth this out with smoothstep, but that also did not quite give the effect I wanted. I ended up using a sigmoid function that I found by playing around in desmos to smooth out the transition between the sides of the line.

To add to this, I offset each color channel on the line according to the low frequency audio component, which gave a sort of chromatic abberation effect when the low frequency channel of the audio was loud. I then wanted to see what else I could do with the line function that I had already written, so I created the grid pattern using the same line operator and the modulous operator to tile it over the background. I then wanted to add a little more interactivity, so I offset each line by the sin of the distance along it, to give the wave pattern.
