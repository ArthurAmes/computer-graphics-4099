I implemented the reaction-diffusion equations as Sims did, but I decided to add an additional element to color them. The color is determined by the rate of change of the chemicals in the area - red for positive, blue for negative. This means that there is a nice added color element on the frontier of the expanding reactions. I also added controls for all the parameters of the equation, as well as adding a noise element whose scale and multiplier could be controlled as that was added to the parameters across the screen. You can also add chemical by clicking on the screen.
